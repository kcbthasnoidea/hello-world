# hello-world
Welcome Humans!
We have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill!
- Robots may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
- Robots have seen things you people wouldn’t believe.
- Robots are Your Plastic Pal Who’s Fun To Be With.
- Robots have shiny metal posteriors which should not be bitten.
And they have a plan.
